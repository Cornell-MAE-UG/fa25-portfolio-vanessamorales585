Ethics is an often overlooked topic in engineering, one that I strongly believe should be taught alongside technical courses. In MAE 4300, I delved into several topics related to ethical analysis. As a professional engineer I plan to always let my moral compass guide me, and uphold the ASME code of ethics for engineers in all my endeavors.

In 2018 and 2019 fatal crashes involving the Boeing 737 MAX ocurred as a result of several unethical decisions. This case is extremely important for engineers to study, and many lessons can be learned about the moral duties we have as engineers.
