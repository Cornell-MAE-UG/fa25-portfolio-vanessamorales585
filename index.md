## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a senior majoring in mechanical engineering at Cornell University. I have enjoyed studying topics such as mechanics of materials and mechatronics. I have also taken many courses in computer science, and have a passion for coding.

My goal is to work in the medical device industry, improving patients lives with my skills. I find biomechanics particularly interesting and I am hoping to make a positive impact with my career.
